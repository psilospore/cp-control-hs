# Python DSL to PRISM compiler

### Usage

Models used for experimental results are found in `bin/` using action filter value (i.e., shield value $\lambda'$) of `0.7`. To generate models for a different action filter value `AF` run:
```
./bin/gen_script.sh <AF>
```

This script will generate 6 PRISM models in the files:
* bin/ShieldedConfPred\_StochDyn\_DefAct\_acc90\_conf95\_af7.pm
* bin/ShieldedConfPred\_StochDyn\_DefAct\_acc90\_conf995\_af7.pm
* bin/ShieldedConfPred\_StochDyn\_DefAct\_acc90\_conf99\_af7.pm
* bin/ShieldedConfPred\_StochDyn\_acc90\_conf95\_af7.pm
* bin/ShieldedConfPred\_StochDyn\_acc90\_conf995\_af7.pm
* bin/ShieldedConfPred\_StochDyn\_acc90\_conf99\_af7.pm
  
`acc` refers too the accuracy of the baseline DNN model. `conf` is the accuracy of the conformalized model. `af` refers to the action filter value.

These PRISM models are generated using a hand-coded description of the autonomous taxiing agent in `src/TaxiShieldedConfPred.py`, confusion matrices for the conformalized DNN in `lib`, and a perfect-perception shield in `lib/temp_extr_dir_3.csv`. The confusion matrices are generated by functionality in `/train/` and the shield was  was generated from `lib/tempest_raw_3.txt` using:
```
python3 src/TempestExtractor.py direct -tf lib/tempest_raw_3.txt -df lib/temp_extr_dir_3.csv
```

The file `lib/tempest_raw_3.txt` itself was generated by functionality in `/shielding/`.
