### Shielding
1. `build_shield.py` is the script to generate the shield for the perfect-perception MDP. Before running this script, you need to download the [PRISM](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/) model checker on your machine and modify `PRISM_PATH` in the script to point to the PRISM binary.

2. `tempest` folder contains instructions to generate shield using the [Tempest](https://tempest-synthesis.org/) tool. We do not use this tool for the current work.
